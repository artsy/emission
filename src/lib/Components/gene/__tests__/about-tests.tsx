    description: `Deep time refers to the concept of an expansive time that stretches far beyond human history to
                  include the approximately 4.5 billion-year geological history of Earth and the estimated 13.8
                  billion-year history of the universe. In art, deep time could be explored in works that deal with the
                  long-term processes of geological formation and the cosmos. Such concerns are important, for example,
                  to [Hiroshi Sugimoto](/artist/hiroshi-sugimoto)’s waterscapes and Darren Almond’s landscapes, both of
                  which use long-exposure photography to capture a sense of expanded time.`,
