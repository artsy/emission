/**
 * Given Xcode project and path, iterate over all build configurations
 * and execute func with HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS from current section
 *
 * We cannot use builtin addToHeaderSearchPaths method since react-native init does not
 * use $(TARGET_NAME) for PRODUCT_NAME, but sets it manually so that method will skip
 * that target.
 *
 * To workaround that issue and make it more bullet-proof for different names,
 * we iterate over all configurations and look if React is already there. If it is,
 * we assume we want to modify that section either
 *
 * Important: That function mutates `buildSettings` and it's not pure thus you should
 * not rely on its return value
